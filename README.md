# nhs-coordinator / Image Recognition

The training and test data has been mostly excluded from this repo for the purposes of conciseness.
Credit goes to the FER-2013 project; Data downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013

This was not actually used in the end, because the accuracy of the model was too low. Instead the FER module was used https://github.com/mayurmadnani/fer

See README.md in branch master for more information on the purposes of this branch.
